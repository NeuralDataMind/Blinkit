# Blinkit Business Intelligence Dashboard

## üìä Introduction

This project is a comprehensive business intelligence dashboard built with Power BI to analyze and visualize the performance of Blinkit, a leading quick-commerce company. This dashboard transforms raw operational data into actionable insights, providing a 360-degree view of the business across sales, customer behavior, inventory management, marketing efforts, and customer feedback.

The primary goal is to empower stakeholders with an interactive and user-friendly tool to monitor Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to foster growth.

  - How effective are our marketing campaigns in terms of ROI, clicks, and conversions?
  - Who are our most valuable customers, and what is the customer retention and churn rate?
  - How can we optimize our inventory by tracking stock levels, movement, and damaged goods?
  - What is the overall customer sentiment, and what are the most common areas of feedback?
